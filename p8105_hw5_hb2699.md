### Problem 2

Import the dataset

``` r
data_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv"
homicide = read_csv(url(data_url)) 
```

The raw dataset collects data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities. It
has 52179 observations of homicides and 12 key variables representing
uid, reported date, victims’ last name, first name, race, age, sex,
city, state, latitude, longitude, and disposition.

Then we create a `city_state` variable and a `resolved` variable to
indicate whether the homicides were solved. There was one observation
was mis-recorded as “Tulsa, AL” and we plan to drop it since Tulsa is
the city in the state of Oklahoma rather than Alabama.
